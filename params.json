Calibration was performed using precipitation and streamflow data from the MOPEX dataset over the period 1962–1972 with a one-year warmup period. Four objective functions are optimized: the Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), which measures the model fit primarily during high-flow periods; the Box-Cox transformed root mean squared error (TRMSE), which accounts for low-flow periods; the runoff coefficient error (ROCE), which accounts for the long-term water balance; and the slope of the flow duration curve error (SFDCE), which measures the ability of the model to match the long-term variability of flows.\r\n\r\nContents:\r\n* HBV_src/: C++ source code for the HBV model\r\n* params/: MOEA parameters to be sampled for each algorithm\r\n* Java files: to define the HBV problem for MOEAFramework and submit PBS cluster jobs\r\n* generateSampling.sh: Create the Latin Hypercube samples of algorithm parameters\r\n* HBV_Reference.txt: The benchmark reference set from this study\r\n\r\nTo compile and run:\r\n\r\n* Make sure you have [MOEAFramework](http://www.moeaframework.org). Download the \"all-in-one executable\" and put the .jar file in the main directory of this project.\r\n\r\n* Compile the HBV Model: `cd HBV_src && make`\r\n\r\n* Move the executable and data file into the main directory: `mv hbv WIL.in ..`\r\n\t\r\n* Compile all of the Java files as shown below. (Before you compile `ExampleJobFactory.java`, you may want to read through the file and see if you want to modify any parts of the setup.)\r\n\r\n\t`javac -classpath MOEAFramework-<VERSION>-Executable.jar:. HBVProblem.java`\r\n\r\n* Generate MOEA parameters: `./generateSampling.sh`\r\n\r\n* Run `ExampleJobFactory` to submit jobs to a PBS queue. If you read the file ExampleJobFactory.java, you will see which algorithms and random seeds will be submitted by default. Change these as needed.\r\n\r\n\t`java -classpath MOEAFramework-<VERSION>-Executable.jar:. ExampleJobFactory -seed 0`\r\n\r\n\tThe `-seed` argument is optional. If omitted, 50 seeds will be run.\r\n\r\n* You can perform a regular (non-PBS) run like this:\r\n```\r\njava -classpath MOEAFramework-<VERSION>-Executable.jar:. \\\r\norg.moeaframework.analysis.sensitivity.Evaluator \\\r\n--parameterFile ./path/to/file \\\r\n--input ./path/to/LHS/file \\\r\n--problem HBV \\\r\n--algorithm NSGAII \\\r\n--seed 0 \\\r\n--output ./path/NSGAII_HBV_0.out \\ \r\n--full \\\r\n-x epsilon=0.01,0.025,0.01,0.01\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe HBV Benchmark Problem is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThe HBV Benchmark Problem is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
